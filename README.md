# MentionTextField

This is a pure composable to handle mention functionality. For the XML View [check out this](https://github.com/catalyzedgrey/mention-edit-text). The mention selection popup supports paginated lists and search. The search functionality accounts for the first two words after the '@' symbol separated by a space.
